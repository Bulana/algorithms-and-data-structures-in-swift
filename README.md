Swift Syntax Review
--------------------------

Swift revision covering:

    1. Two types of comments i.e one line(//) and multiline comment(/* blah blah */)
    
    2. Declaration/Initialization
    
    3. In Swift, declaration must occur first before initialiation, you can't initialize a variable/constant that was not declared
```
    
                let answer: Int //DECLARE!
                answer = 100    //INITIALIZE!
```
    4. Or do it in one line, by using type inference
```
                let answer = 100 //INFERED TYPE IS INT
```                
    5. Data Types
